# ProtoSeg with UNet Integration

## Overview

**ProtoSeg with UNet Integration** is a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of **ProtoSeg**, a prototype-based segmentation approach, with the powerful **UNet** architecture for image segmentation tasks. This integration aims to enhance segmentation performance, especially for datasets with sparse annotations or noisy data.

The project leverages ProtoSeg's ability to generalize well on limited data and UNet's efficiency in precise localization, making it suitable for challenging applications such as biomedical image segmentation.



## Features

- **Prototype-Based Learning**: Enhances generalization and robustness using class prototypes.
- **UNet Backbone**: Employs the encoder-decoder structure for high-quality segmentation results.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable architecture to adapt to various datasets and tasks.
- **Improved Performance**: Designed to work well on datasets with limited annotations or high variability.



## Applications

This framework is particularly suited for:
- **Medical Image Segmentation**: CT scans, MRIs, and other imaging modalities.
- **Few-Shot Segmentation**: Tasks with limited labeled examples.
- **Noisy Data Segmentation**: Datasets with low-quality inputs.


## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Prepare your dataset with input images and corresponding masks in the specified format.



## How It Works

This integration combines:

1. **Prototype-Based Learning**:
   - ProtoSeg generates class prototypes that guide the segmentation process, improving generalization.

2. **UNet Architecture**:
   - The UNet backbone provides a structured approach to encode spatial context and decode precise segmentations.

By merging these methods, the framework achieves better results on datasets with complex structures or limited labeled data.



## Results

This approach has shown improvements in segmentation accuracy on benchmark datasets, with metrics such as Dice Score and Intersection over Union (IoU) demonstrating significant gains. Qualitative results showcase clear and precise segmentations even in challenging scenarios.



## Future Work

Planned improvements include:
- Extending support for multi-class segmentation.
- Enhancing performance on real-world noisy datasets.
- Integrating additional pre- and post-processing techniques for improved results.
